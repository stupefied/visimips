# visimips
ViSiMIPS simulates and dynamically visualizes the processing of instructions by MIPS32 pipelined processor to assist in teaching such concepts. Its graphical user interface (GUI) illustrates the register-transfer level and expedites students to comprehend the different stages of pipelining.

I worked on this academic project for my final year project requirements (around 2010). I feel like the classes and controllers can be reused for other similar projects.
